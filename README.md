Dear potential future employers, **please note** that this is not how I usually
write code. I happen to be pressed for time to hand this in and it turns out
that either a) I'm actually not that clever or b) the edge cases of the
underlying method—which was somebody else's idea, because I'm not *that*
clever—are in fact not that clearly defined, while C++ is lacking the
expressive power required to *somehow do it like this*. So yeah, I'm aware of
the spaghetti and I apologize for the mess.
