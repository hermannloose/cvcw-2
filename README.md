# Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) #

Dear potential future employers, **please note** that this is not how I usually
write code. I happen to be pressed for time to hand this in and it turns out
that either a) I'm actually not that clever or b) the edge cases of the
underlying method—which is somebody else's, because I'm not *that* clever—are
in fact not that clearly defined, while C++ is lacking the expressive power
required to *somehow do it like this*. So yeah, I'm aware of the spaghetti and
I apologize for the mess.
